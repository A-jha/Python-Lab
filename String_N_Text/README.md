# String And Text

## Splitting Strings on Any of Multiple Delimiters

- The split() method of string objects is really meant for very simple cases, and does not allow for multiple delimiters or account for possible whitespace around the delimiters.

- The re.split() function is useful because you can specify multiple patterns for the separator.

## Matching Text at the Start or End of a String

- A simple way to check the beginning or end of a string is to use the

  - str.startswith('http//')

  - str.endswith('.py') methods.

## Matching Strings Using Shell Wildcard Patterns

- wildcard patterns as are commonly used when working in Unix shells (e.g., _.py , Dat[0-9]_.csv , etc.).

- **fnmatch()**
  Test whether FILENAME matches PATTERN.

Patterns are Unix shell style: matches everything ? matches any single character [seq] matches any character in seq [!seq] matches any char not in seq An initial period in FILENAME is not special. Both FILENAME and PATTERN are first case-normalized if the operating system requires it. If you don't want this, use fnmatchcase(FILENAME, PATTERN).

Normally, fnmatch() matches patterns using the same case-sensitivity rules as the systemâ€™s underlying filesystem (which varies based on operating system).

For example:

```Python
>>> # On OS X (Mac)
>>> fnmatch('foo.txt', '*.TXT')
False
>>> # On Windows
>>> fnmatch('foo.txt', '*.TXT')
True
>>>
```

- **fnmatchcase()**
  If this distinction matters, use fnmatchcase() instead. It matches exactly based on the lower- and uppercase conventions that you supply.

```python
>>> fnmatchcase('foo.txt', '*.TXT')
False
```
